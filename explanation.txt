After properly configuring pythonâ€™s open/file and csv modules to read the data, the most obvious issue with the data became rows that where distributed between lines.
Some rows have spaces for certain values. It becomes hard to distinguish from actual spaces and bad data.
The fatal flaw for my solution is that is a row that is distributed between different lines contains a space as an intended value, my solution would fail to catch such a case. My solution would automatically reset whenever it sees a new valid row, such an error would be compartmentalized and not affect the rest of that data. 
The example data did not have such a row.
Outside of eyeballing the output, I looked at number of values per row and the incremental integer values of the first column to validate my data.
